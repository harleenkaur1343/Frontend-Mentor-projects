## Overview

### The challenge
Create a rating card and display the choosen rating in a thank you message.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
Decide the layout - Number of container <div> and all the elements used. Apply css styling to them and adding Javascript at last.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google fonts

### What I learned

This project helped me to brush up the concepts of Javascript and the states associated with the elements.

### Continued development

I would like to build projects where the emphasis is on the advanced practical implementation of Javascript and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for giving an idea about how to implement hover functionality after a rating is clicked (as it stopped working - CSS hover). 

- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - This is an amazing article which helped me recall the CSS pseudo classes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
